            <p>
                EN-001 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Access to EN-001 requires
                Level<br>
                2 clearance, and all testing must be approved by the current Site Director. Personnel handling<br>
                EN-001 are to undergo routine psychological evaluations to monitor for any unintended effects on<br>
                mental well-being. In the event of misuse or unauthorized access, appropriate disciplinary
                action<br>
                will be taken.<br>

            </p>


            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

            <p>EN-001 is a pair of non-anomalous eyeglasses resembling mid-20th-century prescription spectacles.
                The<br>
                frames are made of tortoiseshell-patterned plastic, and the lenses are clear glass. No markings
                or<br>
                brand names are present on the glasses, and attempts to trace their origin have been
                unsuccessful.<br>
                <br>


            </p>
            <p>
                When a person wears EN-001, they experience a heightened ability to recall and vividly visualize<br>
                memories. The glasses seem to enhance the wearer's memory retrieval processes, allowing them to<br>
                remember details with exceptional clarity. Subjects report that memories appear more vibrant,
                with<br>
                increased sensory details such as colors, sounds, and scents.<br>

            <p>
                Testing has shown that EN-001 does not alter or manipulate<br>
                the actual memories themselves but enhances the individual's <br>
                capacity to access and relive them. The glasses have been observed <br>
                to work on memories of various ages and types, including long-term <br>
                and short-term memories.<br>

            </p>

            <p>
                EN-001 was discovered in the possession of a retired librarian,<br>
                who reported the glasses' ability to improve her recall of<br>
                historical events and archival information. The Foundation<br>
                became aware of EN-001 after reports of the librarian accurately<br>
                recalling minute details from her past, including<br>
                specific dates, conversations, and even unrelated events.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to its benign nature and lack of any harmful effects, EN-001 has been classified as Safe.<br>
                However, access to EN-001 is restricted to authorized personnel for research purposes only.<br>
                Experimentation is ongoing to determine the full extent of EN-001's capabilities and potential<br>
                applications in aiding memory-related disorders.<br>

            <h2>Experiment Log - EN-001</h2>

            <p><b>Experiment Title: </b> Memory Enhancement Testing</p>

            <p><b>Objective: </b> To assess the extent of EN-001's memory enhancement capabilities on human subjects.
            </p>


            <p><b>Procedure: </b> A controlled experiment will be conducted with a group of ten D-Class personnel.
                Each<br>
                subject will be provided with EN-001 and asked to recall specific details from a series of
                standardized<br>
                memory tests. The tests will include recalling lists of words, numbers, and images presented to the<br>
                subjects. The control group will undergo the same tests without wearing EN-001.</p>

            <p><b>Variables: </b> </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Independent Variable:</b> Wearing EN-001.</li>
                    <li><b>Dependent Variables:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Accuracy of memory recall.</li>
                            <li>Speed of memory retrieval.</li>
                            <li>Subjective experience of enhanced memory.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Experiment Timeline:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Pre-Experiment:</b> All subjects will undergo a baseline memory assessment to establish a
                        control for comparison.</li>
                    <li><b>Phase 1: </b> Subjects wearing EN-001 will undergo memory tests, while the control group will
                        undergo the same tests without wearing EN-001.</li>
                    <li><b>Interim Assessment: </b> Subjects will be asked to provide feedback on their experience
                    wearing EN-001, focusing on any notable changes in memory perception.</li>
                    <li><b>Phase 2: </b> Subjects will switch conditions (EN-001 wearers become the control group, and
                        vice versa) to eliminate potential bias.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Post-Experiment: </b>A final memory assessment will be conducted on both groups to measure
                        any lasting effects of wearing EN-001.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record accuracy and speed of memory recall for each subject.</li>
                    <li>Document subjective feedback regarding the experience of wearing EN-001.</li>
                    <li>Monitor for any adverse psychological effects during and after the experiment.</li>
                </ol>


            <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Informed consent will be obtained from all D-Class personnel participating in the experiment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Psychological support and counseling will be made available to subjects before and after the
                        experiment.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>
                <b>Note: </b>
                This experiment aims to better understand the practical applications and limitations of EN-001's memory
                enhancement capabilities. Results will inform future research and potential uses of EN-001 in
                memory-related disorders or cognitive enhancement.
