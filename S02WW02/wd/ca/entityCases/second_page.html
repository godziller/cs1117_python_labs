            <p>
                The creative arts department is to be monitored at all times for signs of SCP-EN-002 manifestation.
                In<br>
                the event of its appearance, the affected area is to be cordoned off, and access restricted until<br>
                SCP-EN-002 dematerializes. No direct contact is to be made with SCP-EN-002 without prior approval
                from<br>
                Level 3 personnel.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Artistic events, performances, or exhibitions held within the creative arts department must be
                approved<br>
                by the Site Director to prevent unintentional activation or influence by SCP-EN-002. Any personnel<br>
                reporting anomalous inspiration or artistic visions are to be interviewed, and affected works of art
                are<br>
                to be cataloged and contained.<br></p>



            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

            <p> SCP-EN-002 is an enigmatic entity resembling a humanoid figure with ephemeral, ethereal features,
                often<br>
                manifesting as a shimmering silhouette within the creative arts department of University College
                Cork<br>
                (UCC). The entity's appearance is accompanied by a soft, melodic hum that varies in intensity and<br>
                pitch.<br>

            </p>

            <p>SCP-EN-002 exhibits an anomalous influence on artistic expression and creativity in individuals
                within<br>
                its proximity. Subjects often report heightened inspiration and a deep connection to their creative<br>
                faculties when exposed to SCP-EN-002. The entity appears to selectively choose individuals, with no<br>
                discernible pattern in its selection process.<br></p>

            <p>The manifestation of SCP-EN-002 is unpredictable, occurring without apparent trigger or pattern.
                Attempts<br>
                to predict or summon the entity have proven unsuccessful. SCP-EN-002 dematerializes after a variable<br>
                period, ranging from minutes to several hours, leaving no trace of its presence</p>

            <h2>Experiment Log - EN-002</h2>

            <p><b>Experiment Title: </b> Artistic Inspiration Analysis</p>

            <p><b>Objective: </b> To study the effects of exposure to SCP-EN-002 on human creativity and assess the
                influence of the entity on artistic expression.


            </p>


            <p><b>Procedure:</b>A controlled experiment will be conducted with a group of five individuals from the<br>
                creative arts department at UCC. Subjects will be exposed to SCP-EN-002 for varying durations,
                ranging<br>
                from 15 minutes to one hour. Observations will focus on changes in artistic inspiration, creativity,
                and<br>
                any anomalous effects on the resulting artworks.</p>

            <p><b>Variables: </b> </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Independent Variable:</b>Duration of exposure to SCP-EN-002.</li>
                    <li><b>Dependent Variables:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Changes in artistic inspiration and creativity.</li>
                            <li>The emotional and psychological impact of SCP-EN-002 on subjects.</li>
                            <li>Manifestation of anomalous effects in the resulting artworks.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Experiment Timeline:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Pre-Experiment:</b> All subjects will undergo baseline psychological assessments and provide
                        samples of their previous works for comparison.</li>

                    <li><b>Phase 1: </b> Subjects will be exposed to SCP-EN-002 for 15 minutes, and observations will
                        focus on immediate changes in artistic inspiration and creativity..</li>

                    <li><b>Interim Assessment </b> : Subjects will participate in daily debriefings, providing insights
                        into their experiences and any anomalous phenomena observed.</li>

                    <li><b>Phase 2: </b> Duration of exposure will be incrementally increased in subsequent sessions (30
                        minutes, 45 minutes, and one hour).</li>

                    <li><b>Post-Experiment: </b>Subjects will undergo final psychological assessments, and the resulting
                        artworks will be analyzed for anomalous effects.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record changes in subjects' artistic inspiration and creativity during and after exposure to
                        SCP-EN-002.</li>
                    <li>Document emotional and psychological impacts reported by subjects.</li>
                    <li>Analyze resulting artworks for any anomalous effects or themes consistent with SCP-EN-002
                        influence.</li>
                </ol>


            <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring awareness of SCP-EN-002 and
                        its potential effects.</li>
                    <li>Psychological support and counseling will be provided before, during, and after exposure to
                        SCP-EN-002.</li>
                    <li>Emergency protocols will be in place to halt the experiment in the event of severe psychological
                        distress or anomalous effects.</li>
                    <li>Contingency plans will be established to address any unintended consequences or anomalous
                        effects resulting from exposure to SCP-EN-002.</li>
                </ol>


            <p>
                <b>Note: </b>
                While SCP-EN-002 has been assigned a Euclid classification, its low-level Keter classification is
                pending further assessment due to potential risks associated with unintended artistic manifestations and
                emotional impact on exposed individuals. Additional research is ongoing to understand the entity's
                nature and the full extent of its anomalous effects.
