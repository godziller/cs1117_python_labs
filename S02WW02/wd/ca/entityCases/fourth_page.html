            <p>
                EN-004, known as the Whispering Mirror, is to be housed in a standard secure locker at Site-██. Access
                <br>
                to the locker is restricted to Level 2 personnel, and any experimentation requires approval from the
                <br>
                Site Supervisor. The locker is to be checked monthly for any signs of wear or damage.<br>



            </p>

            <p>
                Personnel interacting with EN-004 should be made aware of its potential psychological effects, and <br>
                extended exposure is discouraged. If any unusual occurrences or heightened emotional states are<br>
                reported, personnel are to cease interaction immediately, and a psychological evaluation is to be<br>
                conducted.<br>


            </p>


            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

            <p>
                The Whispering Mirror (EN-004) is a vintage, ornate mirror with an intricately designed wooden
                frame.<br>
                The glass itself is slightly warped, giving a distorted reflection. When a person gazes into the
                mirror<br>
                for an extended period, they report hearing faint whispers, often resembling hushed conversations or<br>
                indistinct voices.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The whispers are unique to each observer, seemingly addressing personal fears, desires, or
                unresolved<br>
                issues. Subjects have reported a heightened emotional response and occasional feelings of unease
                after<br>
                interacting with EN-004. The mirror does not display any anomalous properties in terms of physical<br>
                reflection.<br>
            <p>
                Efforts to communicate with the source of the whispers have been unsuccessful. No discernible origin
                or<br>
                entity has been identified within the mirror.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Experiment Log - EN-004-01:</h2>

            <p><b>Experiment Title: </b> Memory Enhancement Testing</p>

            <p><b>Objective: </b> To observe the effects of prolonged exposure to Whispering Mirror.
            </p>


            <p><b>Procedure:</b>
                D-67890, equipped with a voice recorder, was instructed to gaze into EN-004 for 10 minutes.

            </p>

            <p><b>Results : </b> </p>
            <p>
                D-67890 reported hearing whispers that seemed to reference past traumas and personal regrets.<br>
                Post-experiment, D-67890 exhibited signs of emotional distress, including increased anxiety. Analysis
                of<br>
                the voice recording revealed indistinct murmurs and whispers, though no clear origin could be<br>
                determined.<br>
            </p>


            <p>


                <b>Addendum: EN-004-A</b>
                Due to the unpredictable nature of the emotional impact reported by individuals interacting with the<br>
                Whispering Mirror, caution is advised. Regular monitoring of personnel who have interacted with
                EN-004<br>
                is recommended, and any significant emotional disturbances should be promptly addressed through<br>
                counseling and support services.<br>
