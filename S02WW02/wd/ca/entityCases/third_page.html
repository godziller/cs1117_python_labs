            <H2>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES</H2>

            <p>
                EN-003, designated Ephemeral Nexus, is to be stored within a standard containment chamber at
                Site-███,<br>
                previously housed at University College Cork, Ireland. Access to the chamber requires Level 3
                clearance,<br>
                and all personnel entering must undergo psychological evaluation before and after interaction with<br>
                Ephemeral Nexus. The containment chamber must be equipped with a two-way communication system for<br>
                monitoring purposes.<br>


            </p>

            <p>
                Any experimentation involving Ephemeral Nexus requires written approval from Site Director Dr.
                ██████.<br>
                In the event of unexpected behavior or anomalous activity, personnel are instructed to immediately<br>
                vacate the containment chamber and report the incident to Site Security. <br>

            </p>


            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

            <p>
                Ephemeral Nexus (EN-003) was discovered on [DATA EXPUNGED] in the ████████ Forest, Germany, following
                <br>
                reports of unusual weather patterns and electromagnetic disturbances in the area. Ephemeral Nexus is a
                <br>
                humanoid entity measuring approximately 1.8 meters in height. Its appearance is obscured by a thick <br>
                layer of an unknown, viscous substance, preventing direct visual confirmation of its features. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The anomalous properties of Ephemeral Nexus manifest when any sentient being enters its proximity, <br>
                triggering a cognitohazardous effect. Individuals within a 10-meter radius of Ephemeral Nexus experience
                <br>
                vivid hallucinations, typically involving their deepest fears and regrets. Extended exposure to <br>
                Ephemeral Nexus results in severe psychological trauma, leading to symptoms such as insomnia, paranoia,
                <br>
                and suicidal tendencies.
            <p>
                Efforts to communicate with Ephemeral Nexus have been unsuccessful. Attempts to analyze the substance
                <br>
                covering its form have proven challenging, as any samples collected evaporate upon removal from the <br>
                entity. <br>

            <h2>Experiment Log - EN-001</h2>

            <p><b>Experiment Title: </b> Memory Enhancement Testing</p>

            <p><b>Objective: </b> To assess the extent of EN-001's memory enhancement capabilities on human subjects.
            </p>


            <p><b>Procedure:</b>
                D-19234, a Class D personnel, equipped with a recording device and remotely monitored by
                research personnel, entered Ephemeral Nexus's containment chamber.

            </p>

            <p><b>Results : </b> </p>
            <p>
                D-19234 began experiencing hallucinations within 30 seconds of entering the chamber. Hallucinations
                included manifestations of personal traumas and fears. Despite being instructed to leave the chamber
                after five minutes, D-19234 refused, displaying signs of distress and anxiety.
            </p>
            <p>After 10 minutes, D-19234 was evacuated from the chamber. Subsequent psychological evaluations revealed
                severe trauma, and D-19234 was transferred to a psychiatric facility for further observation and
                treatment.</p>

            <p>


                <b>Addendum: </b>
                As of [DATA EXPUNGED], Ephemeral Nexus has displayed no further anomalous activity. All cognitohazardous
                effects appear to have ceased. The entity is considered neutralized, and containment procedures have
                been adjusted accordingly. Research is ongoing to understand the nature of the entity's neutralization
                and to determine if any latent effects persist. The entity was transferred to Site-███ after previously
                being housed at University College Cork, Ireland.
