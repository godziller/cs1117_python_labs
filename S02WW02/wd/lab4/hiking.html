            <h2 id="section-1">Overview</h2>
            <h3 id="section-2">Where is the Kerry Way?</h3>
            <p>
                The Kerry way is in Kerry.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section-3">What is the Kerry Way?</h3>
            <p>
                The Kerry Way is a 200+ km hike around the Iveragh Peninsula.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section-4">
                Why should you hike the Kerry Way?
            </h3>
            <p>
                You will summit peaks, paddle in sparkling bays, and forage in forests, all <br>
                the time marvelling at spectacular Irish countryside. The only downside is<br>
                that you start and end in Killarney.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section-5">
                When is the best time to hike the Kerry Way?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Daytime is the best time to hike the Kerry Way.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section-6">
                In what direction should you hike the Kerry Way?
            </h3>
            <p>
                It all depends on your orientation. If you’re a clockwise dude, then it’s <br>
                better for you to drive the Ring of Kerry; if you swing the other way, then <br>
                hiking the Kerry Way is for you.

            <h3 id="what_to_watch_out_for">What to watch out for!</h3>
            <p>Walking has its dangers:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bears! Bears are mammals with large bodies, shaggy hair, short <br>
                    tails, sharp claws, and bad teeth. Most are omnivores, which means <br>
                    they enjoy fresh hiker with a side order of vegetable matter. <br>
                    However, there are no bears in Ireland.</li>

                <li>
                    Snakes! Snakes are limbless reptiles, found on all continents except <br>
                    for Antarctica. A snake can swallow prey that is larger than its head,<br>
                    which is worrying for small hikers. However, there are no snakes in Ireland.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Wolves! Wolves are like big, devil-eyed dogs. They hunt hikers in packs,<br>
                    encircling any laggards in your party and tearing them limb from limb.<br>
                    However, there are no wolves in Ireland.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>No bears, no snakes, no wolves. I’m not sure why I included this section.</p>

            <ul>

                        <li>Don’t disturb the wildlife, including the locals. </li>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Star Wars fans will know that The Last Jedi features shots of the Skellig Islands, <br>
            which can be seen during your hike.</p>
        <p>Less well known is that the hotel in The Lobster is the Parknasilla Resort and Spa, <br>
            just outside of Sneem village.</p>
        <p>Finally, Lough Leanne is the place where Oisín fell in love with Niamh. <br>
            After 300 ageless loved-up years together in Tír na nÓg, Oisín returned in <br>
            search of his family. But, on touching Irish soil, he aged in an instant and <br>
            died soon after, buried by St. Patrick. So let that be a lesson to you.</p>

                    This should be made clearer in descriptions of this hike.” </p>

                    Kerry Way last Summer. Hearty breakfasts sustained us through the long days. <br>
                    Sure, it rained non-stop. But it deepened our love for this country and for each other.” </p>

                    Starbucks or Dairy Queen. No wi-fi on the mountains. You guys should make Ireland great again.” </p>
