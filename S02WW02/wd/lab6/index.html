                dump it into the nearest supermarket carpark! We can offer your donkey a loving home.

                <p>
                    Ambrose is a striking donkey with a wry sense of humour. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He likes long walks on the beach and
                    braying at the moon.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Polly came to us as a foal, badly malnourished. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After our loving care, she is now a robust young
                    donkey and looking for love.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h3>Ralph</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="ralph.jpg" alt="Ralph, grazing on buttercups" id="ralph_picture"/>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Despite appearances, Ralph is a cantankerous donkey, whom we would be pleased to turn into glue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only kidding, Ralph!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ralph will make an attempt on a world record this year. He hopes to set a new record for the fastest time to eat a banana with no hands. (Luckily for Ralph, he has no hands.)  According to the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i>, the current record is 17.82 seconds. If you would like to <b>sponsor</b> Ralph's attempt on the record, then phone +353 21 1122334. Have your credit card details to hand.
