    <h1>Radiohead</h1>
    <p>
        Radiohead is a band that ticks every box. Know for their experimental compositions, Thom Yorkes harrowing and catatonic <br>
        vocals, Guitar peices that are complex yet simple, drums that often hold a complex pattern, bass that often supplies the very  <br>
        power to the bands persona.

                Vocals
            </h3>
            <p>
                I find the vocals in their music to always compliment the other instruments. Thom's voice is one of a very upset or <br>
                mundane character, but remains a versatile one. He can be seen going from signature, weightless, depressing melodies <br>
                to energetic, wild, desperate "shout" singing. Most of the bands vocal recordings hold a very present and close tone. <br>
                That meaning that the vocals seem close to the users ears with little use of reverb although some tracks do contain it, <br>
                if not heavy reverb, as i said the band is extremely experimental, each album differing from their ther works <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                In an interview Thom told the reporter that, most of the time it isnt his intention to make their songs sounds so sad <br>
                its just how his voice sounds, its his vessel for art. Art, indeed it is art. Another noticable thing about Radioheads vocals is <br>
                the often surreal, poetic style of writing lyrics. Each song tells of odd, almost bizarre combinations of words, ideas <br>
                and scenes. The easiest way i can describe them is like: an aroma that you smell in the strangest place which reminds you <br>
                of something oddly nostalgic or emotional.

            <h3>
                Guitar and Bass
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are two guitarists in Radiohead but i will be talking about the guitar singularly. <br>
                the guitar in Radiohead often bear a clean, close and sensual. Soft picking, to far ambient <br>
                drones and moans. the guitar has also been seen experimenting with distortion, most famously on <br>
                "Creep" which I think just about everyone knows. Ironically thats actually pretty uncommon for <br>
                the lads, distortion wasnt really consistant on any record besides maybe the bends in which had a <br>
                lot noisier, rocky mood about it 
            </p>

            <p>
                Bearing similarity to bands like "The Beatles" instruments (often guitar) were hard paned to one ear. <br>
                for me the most iconic Radiohead tone of guitar would either be 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> A close picked and panned electric guitar with  little effects running through it </li>
                <li>A far and ambient sounds with heavy reverb, chorus, perhaps delay and a stereo or moving sound </li>
                <li>A close acoustic guitar which is often centered, being the centre of that song  </li>
            </ol>

            <p> 
                On the other foot I find the bass playing to be hard to classify. In terms of tone its almost always a close <br>
                and wife clean tone which is very organic sounding, grounding the bands songs in a sense of reality where in <br>
                some songs without the bass would otherwise be loose and unorganised. The bass is integral to their songs. <br>
                Most parts are often quite simple to quite complex, ranging from some root notes and passing notes to odd patterns <br>
                and un syncopated rhythm

                Drums
            </h3>
            <p>
                There is a song that Radio head called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wCJPm19XYQ">Reckoner</a>, that i often find myself trying to tap out<br>
                the rhythm and cant. The drums in their music is a high blend of highly complex syncopation  and simple ground rhythm.<br>
                I find that due to the drums and beat most Radiohead songs are relatively danceable or bopable.
