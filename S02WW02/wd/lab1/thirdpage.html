    <h1>Kendrick Lamar</h1>
    <p>
        In contrast to Radiohead, Kendick Lamar is HipHop. Kendricks music is also deeply poetical, often to be regarded as sometimes TOO <br>
        thought provoking for every day consumption. Personally I disagree, he has got some absolute <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bumpin%20music"> Bumpers</a><br>
        Many regard Kendrick to be the best rapper ever, I agree. Ive listened to allot of hiphop and rap and am yet to find a rapper whose <br>
        music ticks all boxes, those being.

    <ul>
        <li>Good lyrics (Bars)</li>
        <li>A good beat -> this being one thats original, creative, and interesting</li>
        <li>Not Boring</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I used to be moderately into his music until i went to see him live. I can whole heartedly say that it was the best concert ive <br>
        ever been to and ive been to a good few. My favorite album by Kendrick is probably "How To Pimp A Butterfly" due to its jazz and funk <br>
        influences, the Album itself is a 10 and i rarely give that out to any album.
